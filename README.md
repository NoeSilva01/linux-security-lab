# Project: Linux Security Lab Environment Setup

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to build a foundational, isolated virtual lab environment using VirtualBox. This lab serves as a safe space for learning cybersecurity fundamentals, practicing network scanning, vulnerability analysis, ethical hacking techniques, and testing security tools without impacting my main network or computer.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Virtualization:** VirtualBox Version 7.0.18 
* **Host Operating System:** Windows 11
* **Virtual Machines:**
    * Kali Linux [Official VirtualBox Image 2025.1](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/import-premade-virtualbox/)
    * Metasploitable 2 [(Official download)](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/)
    * Ubuntu Server 24.04.2 LTS [Official download](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
## Lab Architecture

### Network Diagram

*( **TODO:** Create a network diagram using diagrams.net or similar, showing the Host, VirtualBox, CyberLabNet, Kali VM, and Metasploitable 2 VM with their IP range. Upload the image file (e.g., `lab_diagram.png`) to this GitHub repository and replace this text with the link: `![Lab Network Diagram](lab_diagram.png)`)*
